# Robotic Motion Planning

A collection of algorithms for control and navigation of mobile robots. These programs were developed during my masters program's EMOR course tutorials (2016-17 session) at Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.

## Requirements
- Matlab
- Peter Corke's Robotics, Vision and Control toolbox
- CoppeliaSim simulator (earlier known as V-REP)
- Matlab bindings for CoppeliaSim

## Overview

The mobile robot used in these projects is a ```KUKA youBot```. It is controlled in a simulated environment (in CoppeliaSim) with bindings to communicate with the control program written in MATLAB.

Inputs to the MATLAB callback function consist of the position and orientation of the robot and data from the LIDAR sensor. Outputs from the program controls the linear and angular velocities of the simulated robot base wheels to perform a specified task. A Finite State Machine (FSM) manages the sequence of robot behaviours, e.g. initial, moving forward, stopping, moving backward.

## Project 1

Introduces trajectory generation and basic control of the simulated Youbot using translational and rotational velocities.

- Straight-line trajectory generation
- Moving along a circular trajectory with constant orientation

The robot motion is generated by using proportional regulators with limited output.

Demos can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hio_rtz3Eo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdUNudgV34g). Code in ```code/solution1a.m``` and ```code/solution1b.m```

## Project 2

Introduce reactive control and navigation for obstacle avoidance using data gathered by LIDAR sensors.
