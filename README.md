# Motion Planning Algorithms for Mobile Robotics

A collection of trajectory planning algorithms for mobile robots. I developed these programs during my masters program's EMOR course tutorials (2016-17 session) at Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.

## Requirements
- Matlab
- Peter Corke's Robotics, Vision and Control toolbox
- CoppeliaSim simulator (earlier known as V-REP)
- Matlab bindings for CoppeliaSim

## Overview

The mobile robot used in these projects is a ```KUKA youBot```. It is controlled in a simulated environment (in CoppeliaSim) with bindings to communicate with the control program written in MATLAB.

Inputs to the MATLAB program consist of the position and orientation of the robot and data from the LIDAR sensor. Outputs from the program controls the linear and angular velocities of the simulated robot base wheels to perform a specified task. A Finite State Machine (FSM) manages the sequence of robot behaviours, e.g. initial, moving forward, stopping, moving backward.

<!-- - Project 1 : Trajectory generation -->
<!-- - Project 2 : Wall following and Bug2 algorithms using LIDAR data -->
<!-- - Project 3 : Robot localization using particle filter, implementation of wavefront planner -->

## Project 1

- Straight-line trajectory generation
- Moving along a circle trajectory with constant orientation

The robot motion is generated by using proportional regulators with limited output.
